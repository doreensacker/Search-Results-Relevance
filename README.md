## Folder Overview
`data` contains the data set used for training and testing the models in this thesis.


## Usage

The code was implemented in *Jupyter Notebooks*. These offer an interactive editor in the Browser. Thereby, the code is extended through MarkDown comments.

In order to view the code with Jupyter notebook, execute:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

A browser tab with the notebook should open.

If you want to view the code as pure Python script, simply convert the Jupyter notebooks with the following command:

```
ipython nbconvert --to script *.ipynb
```
